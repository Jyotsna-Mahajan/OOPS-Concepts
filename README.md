# OOPS-Concepts

There are Four pillars of oops (object oriented programming)
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance - Single Inheritance , Multilevel Inheritance , Multiple Inheritance , Heirarchial Inheritance
5. Polymorphism -  Complie Time Polymorphism - Function Overloading , Runtime Polymorphism - Function Overriding 

And oops also cover 
1. Constructor -  Default Constructor, Parameterized Constructor, Copy Constructor- Shallow copy, Deep copy

2. Virtual Functions
3. Pure Virtual Functions
4. Static Variables

I have practiced programs on all the topics of OOPS.
